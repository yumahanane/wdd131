            <h2>1 Nephi 2:1</h2>
            <p>"For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him:
                Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful
                and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy
                life."</p>

                inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it
                were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness."</p>
