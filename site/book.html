            <p>Perhaps what helped/consoled the Savior in Gethsemane was the perfect knowledge that the pain was momentary. That He
            only had to go through it for a moment. Then He would resurrect and live eternally in peace, without that pain again, in
            the presence of His loving Father. And perhaps what comforted Him was also the perfect knowledge of the importance of
            that experience. He would not be a perfect Savior (lamb) if He did not know us. He can succor us from all our pains,
            illnesses and afflictions because He knows all our pains, illnesses and afflictions.<br><br>
            I think about how alone He must have felt that night. How those close to Him were sleeping while He suffered. He also
            knows loneliness. But that day, an angel was sent from the Father and comforted Him. So, Christ also knows that the
            Father cares about our suffering and gives us a way to endure our afflictions.<br><br>
            That day when [...] [my psychiatrist] was prescribing medication, I froze. I went to the pharmacy but my mind was blank.
            I couldn't feel anything. When I was told the prices of the medicines, I felt something. I understood why people didn't
            seek professional help. The consultation may have been free, but the medications would cost me an arm and a leg.
            Shouldn't I feel better after seeking help? Why was I feeling more anxious? Why was the thing that was supposed to help
            me making me worse? Would it have been better if I hadn't sought help?<br><br>
            I had no money. The medications were very expensive. I went to the hospital to finally be able to work. But now the
            prescription was telling me I needed to work to keep going to the hospital? That didn't make sense.
            [...] [That] weight [was lifted] off my shoulders [when someone offered to pay] [...] for the medication. You don't know
            how grateful I am.<br><br>
            The [...] [psychiatrist] informed me that if I followed the prescription while continuing in therapy, within 6 months I
            would begin to see the effects of the treatment. He didn't lie. It really took a long time. At the beginning of
            treatment, the symptoms became even worse. I started having headaches as soon as I took the medication. I started to
            lose my sense of reality. When I slept, it was as if I was awake. I dreamed, but everything seemed so real, that when I
            woke up, I didn't know how to distinguish reality from dreams.<br><br>
            I asked again: shouldn't I feel better after seeking help? Why am I feeling more irritable, sleepless, depressed and
            anxious? Why am I feeling more suicidal these days? Why is the thing that was supposed to help me making me worse? Would
            it have been better if I hadn't sought help?<br><br>
            I endured everything and didn't give up because of the faith I placed in God. I read my Patriarchal Blessing and it
            reminded me that I am a beloved daughter of God. I believed that, through His grace, “This [illness] too shall pass”.
            Having this belief made me trust in the Lord. So, I trusted the doctors. I trusted the process. I told myself it was a
            6-month process. If I could endure the journey, I would see the end of it. Christ's atonement gave me great strength and
            power to subdue negative thoughts. When the idea of giving up came to mind, I remembered how Christ had endured much
            more than I could imagine, but He stood firm and overcame even death. That the Lord, “Will not suffer […] [us] to be
            tempted above that […] [we] are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that […] [we] may be able
            to bear it. (1 Corinthians 10:13).<br><br>
            Another thing that helped was reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to become. Seeing this photo of me as a child. I thought that child deserved a better life than the one she grew up and had.
            I wondered a lot why I had to go through adversity. Why the Lord allows us to go through so much suffering. The answer
            is in the Plan of Happiness.<br><br>
            We lived in the heavens before coming to earth. There, we were with our Heavenly Father. We were His spiritual children.
            But the Father is of spirit, flesh and bones. He wanted us to become as He is - immortal and eternal (Moses 1:39). And I
            believe that this was not only the Lord's will for us, we also had this desire. We probably saw how wonderful our Father
            is and wanted to be like Him. In the council of heaven, when He explained that the journey would be filled with pain,
            illness, suffering and even death, we probably listened to our Father and thought that the journey was worth it, given
            that at the end of the journey we would become gods like the Father.<br><br>
            He told us that He would send us to earth at a specific time and in a specific place to learn specific lessons. We
            accepted all of this because we understood that we needed it to become like our Father. The Father knew that His plan
            was what we needed to grow and progress. He could have made the earth differently, sent us to earth at a different time,
            placed us in a different family, but He knows everything and never gives commandments without first providing a way (1
            Nephi 9:6).<br><br>
            We believed in Him there in heaven, in the premortal life. If we believe in Him here too, all the pain and suffering we
            have will mean something. It will mean that we love the Eternal Father. And that we love ourselves and want the absolute
            best for ourselves - immortality and eternal life in the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>
            After the Lord presented His plan, Christ presented Himself and volunteered to come to earth and do God's will and give
            all glory to Him (Moses 4:2). Lucifer introduced himself next. He wanted to come to earth and redeem every soul so that
            none would be lost, and he wanted the honor for himself (Moses 4:1-2). The Father chose Christ as our Savior because
            Christ's vision aligned with God's vision. And God's vision was for men to choose for themselves what to follow, how to
            live. The Lord did not want to force us to follow and love Him (Moses 4:3). He loves us infinitely, but He wanted us to
            be free to choose to love Him and gain eternal life and be able to live eternally with Him or choose not to (2 Nephi
            2:27).<br><br>
            Christ is our Savior. He was chosen, not only by God but also by us there in heaven. We agree to come to earth, gain a
            mortal body and “gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize” our “divine destiny as
            heirs of eternal life.” (The Family: A Proclamation to the World). Two-thirds of all God's spiritual children accepted
            this. A third preferred to have Lucifer as their Savior. Lucifer and his followers began a battle against Christ and His
            followers. In the end, we won. Lucifer and his hosts lost and were cast out. We not only choose Christ as our Savior,
            but we also fought for Him to win and be our Savior.<br><br>
            Christ accepted to be our Savior knowing what he would have to go through to save us. He knew all of this and trusted
            that if this was what the Father needed Him to do, then it was important and He needed to do it (Matthew 26:39).
            God is our Father. He loves us and wants our happiness. He wants us to live eternally in his Celestial kingdom. He wants
            us to have the attributes that He has. He wants us to inherit, “thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers,
            dominions, all heights and depths.” For us to become gods and live forever above all things (D&C 132:19-20). He wants us
            to be like Christ.<br><br>
            When Christ lived on earth, He was tempted many times and went through all kinds of afflictions. But He stood firm. He
            was not dissuaded by Satan. God wants us to be like that too, strong in our faith.<br><br>
            It sounds strange to say this, but if I hadn't had so many difficulties at school, I wouldn't have sought therapy.
            Therefore, I would not be where I am today. As a child, I always questioned my value as a person and the purpose of
            life. I grew up not knowing who I was or what I should be, fearing hell, and seeking change, occasionally having the
            thought of death, but not attempting because I was afraid of ending up in hell. At ALA, I learned about depression for
            the first time. Although I concluded that perhaps I was depressed, I didn't dare self-diagnose. After graduation, during
            the internship [...], I interned while applying for the scholarship. This time, the symptoms matched anxiety. Then in
            America, as time went by, with each difficulty I became anxious and depressed. I no longer had any motivation. I
            questioned myself about where I was and where I should go. I didn't have a dream, goals, interests, passions or a
            purpose. [...] I was living miserably. Returning home made things worse. No matter how much meditation, yoga, walking or
            reflection I did, if those things helped me, it was just for a moment.<br><br>
            It was only when I started therapy and treatment that I really began to improve. This happened not just because of the
            medications or the counseling. I improved because I got closer to God. Going to church and studying the scriptures made
            me feel like I was doing something. Receiving God’s forgiveness and being able to partake of the sacrament made me feel
            His love and compassion. Serving made me feel useful. Work made me sick, but the gospel gave me relief and peace knowing
            that I am doing what I need to do to deserve to live with God. But faith alone was not enough either. Studying at BYU
            [Pathway Worldwide Program] has helped me too. In the class where we learned about Goal Setting, I realized that I was
            still living without purpose. I learned that I should know what I want in my life and make a plan to get there. So, I
            made [...] [a] plan.<br><br>
            If I hadn't gone through those difficulties at school, I wouldn't have sought therapy. I would continue to grow up not
            knowing who I am or what I should be, fearing hell, and seeking change, occasionally having the thought of death, but
            not attempting because of the fear of ending up in hell. It seems crazy, but it's true that thanks to the adversities I
            faced, I grew a lot. Today, I know that I am a beloved daughter of God. He really loves me. I know my purpose in life.
            Life remains difficult, but through the gospel I am happy today. I found peace.</p>
