            <h3>Chapter I</h3>
            <p id="chap1">Last Friday, February 18th, 2022, I went to my first consult with a psychologist since I have been home. As soon as I
            got in the car, my heart started racing; an immensurable time faster than it is right now. It is not easy to talk about
            these things, you know?!! I think in that moment, I realized just that. That I was about to talk.<br><br>
            The day before, I was fine. That morning, I was fine. I had just heard an audio from a close friend to whom I had talked
            the day before. She had asked me about my plans. I told her I was going to focus on therapy because I had tried for 2
            years to fix myself on my own, and it did not work. I definitely improved, but I still could not take myself to apply to
            schools or jobs. So, I truly needed help. I knew that unless I worked on what I called 'anxiety,' even if I was able to
            get a job or into a school as I did before in 2021, I still would not be able to commit. I would still be at risk of
            fleeing.<br><br>
            That is what I told my friend on Thursday. Then, on Friday, I woke up with that audio. She was so supportive. She made
            me feel like I was not crazy to decide to take a break from school and work to work on this mental health of mine, that
            was not allowing me to take full advantage of the opportunities I was blessed with. She made me feel like I was going to
            get better, and I would become a better version of myself after this experience, an inspirational person.<br><br>
            But then, getting in that car, what I was about to do felt too real. It was real. It was happening. I was going to the
            Provincial Hospital of Inhambane to talk to a psychologist for free. To try to make this person understand that I was
            not doing fine. What if I am not able to express myself, to portray through words what it is really happening? I
            thought. Sitting there, waiting to be called, without knowing how long that was going to take, the thought stayed there.
            It started getting louder and louder. My heart could hear it. So, the racing intensified. I could clearly feel a
            difference between my left and right side of the chest. The fear was physical.<br><br>
            I wanted to leave. To give up. For a moment there, since I am used to letting 'signs of the universe' decide my destiny,
            this thought came naturally to me, “Maybe this is a sign that I shouldn't be here.” I did not care that they had my
            hospital card, and leaving meant I would lose that card. But then, thinking about how I would have to get a new card, a
            new consult, how even if I left that day, I still had to come back eventually because well… I was pretty messed up,
            thinking that made me stay. It made me take deep breaths and read my patriarchal blessing (a blessing of the priesthood
            that provides guidance). So, I was able to calm down.<br><br>
            But 4 hours of wait is a very long time. For 4 hours, I battled conflicting feelings. Then, finally I got to see the
            psychologist.<br><br>
            Three minutes in, I melt down. Why was I crying in front of that stranger? Am I that bad? That I have become this
            emotional and can't even control myself anymore? Why is it so hard to answer the simple question, “What brings you
            here?” Wait, was that the question? I don't remember. I was too overwhelmed. How do I describe that session?<br><br>
            I had a prepared speech of what was going on. It included some whys that I had come up with. But there, I forgot it. I
            spoke of everything but of nothing. Words just came out of my mouth without much thought. I am not sure I was listening
            to myself. Did I even know what I was talking about? What was that? I was so out of control.<br><br>
            It's funny that every time I went to counselling in college, the same thing happened there. First, I did not know
            anything. A second later, I was talking nonstop. But throughout the whole thing, I did not know anything. Does it make
            sense?<br><br>
            I kept thinking, “What if he thinks I am inventing all this? What if I am not expressing how bad it truly feels? Why
            does he keep asking me questions I already answered? Is he not listening? What if he gives me the wrong diagnosis? What
            if he says there is nothing wrong and sends me home? I can't stay like this. I can't, not anymore.”<br><br>
            I guess I really wanted help, hum?! I spoke of things I was very conscious about. Things I thought, “If I say this, they
            will think I am crazy.” But I guess I really wanted help. I remember thinking, “Even if they tell me I am crazy, it is
            better to have a diagnosis and get treated than keep living like this.” Are you guessing what I am guessing? I guess I
            really …<br><br>
            At the end of the session, the psychologist told me he couldn't help me, alone. He needed help from his colleagues. So,
            on the next consult, he was going to introduce me to a psychiatrist.<br><br>
            A psychiatrist, he said. I felt numb after that. Looks like I am worse than I knew I was.<br><br>
            Was that desperation that I felt? Was that sadness? I can't tell.<br><br>
            When I got home that day, I had laundry to do. And I mean laundry to do by hand. Why did I soap these before I left? Why
            did I think I was going to be able to do housekeeping tasks after the consult? Wait, would normal people still do
            laundry after being in the hospital all morning? Me just wanting to sleep, was it me being lazy?<br><br>
            I don't know exactly how I convinced myself to do the laundry, but I did it. And then, one household task became two and
            then three. Somehow, even though I was exhausted, I did them all. And my mind? Well… still can't explain it.<br><br>
            This kept happening throughout the whole week. Just slowly like this, I was getting better.<br><br>
            A week later…<br><br>
            Do you know what just happened? It rained. I mean, it is raining. My laundry was drying outside. Two more hours, and it
            would have been completely dry. But now, it's all wet again. So, I am hanging it indoor. Some weeks ago, if that
            happened, I would have said, “Argggghh… Why is life against me like this? So now I have to hang these again? I already
            worked. Shouldn't I be resting now? I was falling asleep already. Me, I am tired. Tomorrow, I am not doing laundry if
            the weather forecast says it is going to rain.”<br><br>
            Ha ha ha ha… as if Mr. Weather Forecast always tells the truth.<br><br>
            Do you know what I meant by 'getting better' last time? This is it. This is how different I have been thinking lately,
            “Oh well… life is hard, hum?!! So, maybe tomorrow I will look at the weather forecast before doing laundry. But rain, no
            rain, we can always hang the clothes indoor. Maybe hang indoor from the get-go if there is probable rain.”<br><br>
            Do you see the difference? I see it! I feel it! Good job, Yuma.<br><br>
            Good job to your heart too. It did not race yesterday at your second consult.<br><br>
            I wonder if it would have, had you met the psychiatrist. He wasn't there yesterday, but he will be in 3 days. How will
            your heart be then?<br><br>
            Aaaahhhh… stop that! Let's not start worrying about that now. In 3 days, we'll find out. For now, let's call our
            favorite person in the world.<br><br>
            Grandmaaaaaaaaaaaaaa…<br><br>
            Back in January, I called her again late at night, as soon as I sensed I was going to have a depressive episode. Talking
            to her makes me feel better. And I was in need of feeling better.<br><br>
            It happened in the second week of the month. I heard some news that broke my heart. It took me back to when I lost my
            sister. Did I tell you about her? She was The Sunshine. She had the most beautiful smile with those cute dimples. Her
            laughter alone could brighten the room. She did not have to do anything funny for that. She just had to laugh. She was
            amazing like that. No evil in her heart. Just the most perfect human being. An angel in our lives.<br><br>
            Like my sister, this youngster, I met back in school, was yellow too. We did not interact a lot. But do you know when a
            person is just good? You do not have to be close to them to feel welcomed. He was that person. No evil in his heart it
            seemed. Just an amazing person.<br><br>
            That great man is no more. I asked, “What? Why? How?”<br><br>
            I had the same questions when my sister passed away. I could not comprehend why she was gone at 5 years old. To console
            myself, I thought about the Plan of Salvation, that I was taught at church.<br><br>
            I chose to believe that my sister is that special that she did not have to endure life difficulties for many decades on
            earth. She is safe and in no pain now. She is waiting for us to join her. To live with her eternally in the presence of
            the Savior, the Father, and the Holy Spirit in the Celestial Kingdom.<br><br>
            Disease took her away from us. So, I could make peace with the fact that she was no longer and it was no one's fault.<br><br>
            But my friend, this also yellow soul that only emitted sun rays, how can I make peace with the way he went? Why someone
            that young and bright is gone so early like that? What are the signs that suggest someone is suffering from mental
            illness? How do we know? What can we as family and friends do to help them?<br><br>
            I asked those question again about a week later. When my other friend, another yellow soul with a bright laughter …. Oh,
            his laughter is the best! I do not know anyone else who has a louder laughter than him… this same person who always
            seemed so happy, disappeared after leaving a goodbye letter.<br><br>
            I do not feel comfortable right now talking in depth about the feelings and emotions I had when everything happened. All
            I can say now is that it affected me a lot. I was heartbroken. I just wished and prayed that he was safe somewhere and
            would come home to us.<br><br>
            Can you understand just how relieved I was to hear he was found and treated?! My hope and prayer now are that his mind
            is protected. That he has reached out for help. That he wishes to find a purpose for his life. That he knows that we are
            here for him. There are a lot of us who love him and care about his wellbeing.<br><br>
            The month of January was scary. I wished it was only a nightmare. But it happened. Do you know now why I choose therapy?<br><br>
            Six months into therapy and medication, I felt a peace I had never felt before in my entire life. I felt calm and happy.
            The things that irritated me before, no longer did. I was able to tolerate all the wrong things around me. I was
            grateful for life. I could get out of the bed and just be, without feeling rushed, pressured, nervous, and regretful. I
            knew what peace was.<br><br>
            I also thought I was more normal than everyone else. That everyone in the world need therapy whether they are sick or
            not. That this life has so many things, and without proper guidance, those things can make our brains not work the way
            they should, and we become these people when we could have been those people, but therapy and sometimes medication can
            help our brains be normal.<br><br>

            <h3>Chapter II</h3>
            <p id="chap2">This Netflix series called “Daily Dose of Sunshine” does an amazing job in explaining mental illness. Everyone in the
            world, regardless of their age, should watch it. Watch it to learn to be sensitive to others' struggles, to help those
            in need, and to prevent yourselves from falling.<br><br>
            Insensitive comments have the power to torment the person and to worsen the isolation.<br><br>
            I was ill. How come I am so bad at helping others? Maybe it is because experience does not make me an expert. And the
            illness is something different for every ill person. So, is listening all I can do? Change does not come until one seeks
            it for oneself. So, do I just listen and look from outside waiting for the change? What is a symptom and what is a
            conscious 'normal' decision? Does making sensitive questions worsens the person? If there is physical distance, can
            sensitive conversations take place over a call or text? In the series, the closed ones intervened. Does that always work
            for the best? Can I only intervene when there is an attempt or a plan? Do I just wait? Unsolicited advice is not
            advised. Do I just wait? Pressure worsens the illness. Do I stay quiet? If I know about the person's situation from
            someone other than the person, can I talk about it to the person? If the person asks me to not tell anyone, do I not?
            One cannot deal with these illnesses alone. Do I wait? What am I supposed to do? What can I do?<br><br>
            What if my words and actions worsen things? How can I help the person see my love for them? I am not their savior. They
            have a Savior already. But what can I do?<br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>Chapter III</h3>
            <p id="chap3">The following was my attempt to show my love and care.<br><br>
            Perhaps what helped/consoled the Savior in Gethsemane was the perfect knowledge that the pain was momentary. That He
            only had to go through it for a moment. Then He would resurrect and live eternally in peace, without that pain again, in
            the presence of His loving Father. And perhaps what comforted Him was also the perfect knowledge of the importance of
            that experience. He would not be a perfect Savior (lamb) if He did not know us. He can succor us from all our pains,
            illnesses and afflictions because He knows all our pains, illnesses and afflictions.<br><br>
            I think about how alone He must have felt that night. How those close to Him were sleeping while He suffered. He also
            knows loneliness. But that day, an angel was sent from the Father and comforted Him. So, Christ also knows that the
            Father cares about our suffering and gives us a way to endure our afflictions.<br><br>
            That day when [...] [my psychiatrist] was prescribing medication, I froze. I went to the pharmacy but my mind was blank.
            I couldn't feel anything. When I was told the prices of the medicines, I felt something. I understood why people didn't
            seek professional help. The consultation may have been free, but the medications would cost me an arm and a leg.
            Shouldn't I feel better after seeking help? Why was I feeling more anxious? Why was the thing that was supposed to help
            me making me worse? Would it have been better if I hadn't sought help?<br><br>
            I had no money. The medications were very expensive. I went to the hospital to finally be able to work. But now the
            prescription was telling me I needed to work to keep going to the hospital? That didn't make sense.
            [...] [That] weight [was lifted] off my shoulders [when someone offered to pay] [...] for the medication. You don't know
            how grateful I am.<br><br>
            The [...] [psychiatrist] informed me that if I followed the prescription while continuing in therapy, within 6 months I
            would begin to see the effects of the treatment. He didn't lie. It really took a long time. At the beginning of
            treatment, the symptoms became even worse. I started having headaches as soon as I took the medication. I started to
            lose my sense of reality. When I slept, it was as if I was awake. I dreamed, but everything seemed so real, that when I
            woke up, I didn't know how to distinguish reality from dreams.<br><br>
            I asked again: shouldn't I feel better after seeking help? Why am I feeling more irritable, sleepless, depressed and
            anxious? Why am I feeling more suicidal these days? Why is the thing that was supposed to help me making me worse? Would
            it have been better if I hadn't sought help?<br><br>
            I endured everything and didn't give up because of the faith I placed in God. I read my Patriarchal Blessing and it
            reminded me that I am a beloved daughter of God. I believed that, through His grace, “This [illness] too shall pass”.
            Having this belief made me trust in the Lord. So, I trusted the doctors. I trusted the process. I told myself it was a
            6-month process. If I could endure the journey, I would see the end of it. Christ's atonement gave me great strength and
            power to subdue negative thoughts. When the idea of giving up came to mind, I remembered how Christ had endured much
            more than I could imagine, but He stood firm and overcame even death. That the Lord, “Will not suffer […] [us] to be
            tempted above that […] [we] are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that […] [we] may be able
            to bear it. (1 Corinthians 10:13).<br><br>
            Another thing that helped was reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to become. Seeing this photo of me as a child. I thought that child deserved a better life than the one she grew up and had.
            I wondered a lot why I had to go through adversity. Why the Lord allows us to go through so much suffering. The answer
            is in the Plan of Happiness.<br><br>
            We lived in the heavens before coming to earth. There, we were with our Heavenly Father. We were His spiritual children.
            But the Father is of spirit, flesh and bones. He wanted us to become as He is - immortal and eternal (Moses 1:39). And I
            believe that this was not only the Lord's will for us, we also had this desire. We probably saw how wonderful our Father
            is and wanted to be like Him. In the council of heaven, when He explained that the journey would be filled with pain,
            illness, suffering and even death, we probably listened to our Father and thought that the journey was worth it, given
            that at the end of the journey we would become gods like the Father.<br><br>
            He told us that He would send us to earth at a specific time and in a specific place to learn specific lessons. We
            accepted all of this because we understood that we needed it to become like our Father. The Father knew that His plan
            was what we needed to grow and progress. He could have made the earth differently, sent us to earth at a different time,
            placed us in a different family, but He knows everything and never gives commandments without first providing a way (1
            Nephi 9:6).<br><br>
            We believed in Him there in heaven, in the premortal life. If we believe in Him here too, all the pain and suffering we
            have will mean something. It will mean that we love the Eternal Father. And that we love ourselves and want the absolute
            best for ourselves - immortality and eternal life in the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>
            After the Lord presented His plan, Christ presented Himself and volunteered to come to earth and do God's will and give
            all glory to Him (Moses 4:2). Lucifer introduced himself next. He wanted to come to earth and redeem every soul so that
            none would be lost, and he wanted the honor for himself (Moses 4:1-2). The Father chose Christ as our Savior because
            Christ's vision aligned with God's vision. And God's vision was for men to choose for themselves what to follow, how to
            live. The Lord did not want to force us to follow and love Him (Moses 4:3). He loves us infinitely, but He wanted us to
            be free to choose to love Him and gain eternal life and be able to live eternally with Him or choose not to (2 Nephi
            2:27).<br><br>
            Christ is our Savior. He was chosen, not only by God but also by us there in heaven. We agree to come to earth, gain a
            mortal body and “gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize” our “divine destiny as
            heirs of eternal life.” (The Family: A Proclamation to the World). Two-thirds of all God's spiritual children accepted
            this. A third preferred to have Lucifer as their Savior. Lucifer and his followers began a battle against Christ and His
            followers. In the end, we won. Lucifer and his hosts lost and were cast out. We not only choose Christ as our Savior,
            but we also fought for Him to win and be our Savior.<br><br>
            Christ accepted to be our Savior knowing what he would have to go through to save us. He knew all of this and trusted
            that if this was what the Father needed Him to do, then it was important and He needed to do it (Matthew 26:39).
            God is our Father. He loves us and wants our happiness. He wants us to live eternally in his Celestial kingdom. He wants
            us to have the attributes that He has. He wants us to inherit, “thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers,
            dominions, all heights and depths.” For us to become gods and live forever above all things (D&C 132:19-20). He wants us
            to be like Christ.<br><br>
            When Christ lived on earth, He was tempted many times and went through all kinds of afflictions. But He stood firm. He
            was not dissuaded by Satan. God wants us to be like that too, strong in our faith.<br><br>
            It sounds strange to say this, but if I hadn't had so many difficulties at school, I wouldn't have sought therapy.
            Therefore, I would not be where I am today. As a child, I always questioned my value as a person and the purpose of
            life. I grew up not knowing who I was or what I should be, fearing hell, and seeking change, occasionally having the
            thought of death, but not attempting because I was afraid of ending up in hell. At ALA, I learned about depression for
            the first time. Although I concluded that perhaps I was depressed, I didn't dare self-diagnose. After graduation, during
            the internship [...], I interned while applying for the scholarship. This time, the symptoms matched anxiety. Then in
            America, as time went by, with each difficulty I became anxious and depressed. I no longer had any motivation. I
            questioned myself about where I was and where I should go. I didn't have a dream, goals, interests, passions or a
            purpose. [...] I was living miserably. Returning home made things worse. No matter how much meditation, yoga, walking or
            reflection I did, if those things helped me, it was just for a moment.<br><br>
            It was only when I started therapy and treatment that I really began to improve. This happened not just because of the
            medications or the counseling. I improved because I got closer to God. Going to church and studying the scriptures made
            me feel like I was doing something. Receiving God’s forgiveness and being able to partake of the sacrament made me feel
            His love and compassion. Serving made me feel useful. Work made me sick, but the gospel gave me relief and peace knowing
            that I am doing what I need to do to deserve to live with God. But faith alone was not enough either. Studying at BYU
            [Pathway Worldwide Program] has helped me too. In the class where we learned about Goal Setting, I realized that I was
            still living without purpose. I learned that I should know what I want in my life and make a plan to get there. So, I
            made [...] [a] plan.<br><br>
            If I hadn't gone through those difficulties at school, I wouldn't have sought therapy. I would continue to grow up not
            knowing who I am or what I should be, fearing hell, and seeking change, occasionally having the thought of death, but
            not attempting because of the fear of ending up in hell. It seems crazy, but it's true that thanks to the adversities I
            faced, I grew a lot. Today, I know that I am a beloved daughter of God. He really loves me. I know my purpose in life.
            Life remains difficult, but through the gospel I am happy today. I found peace.</p>
            <h3>Chapter IV</h3>
            <p id="chap4">Now, let me give you one more piece of my mind.<br><br>
            Being easily irritable is not normal. Being aggressive is not normal. Thinking people are to get you is not normal.
            Eating only some meals is not normal. Sleeping too little is not normal. Sleeping too much is not normal. Body aching
            for no reason is not normal. Learn to recognize the symptoms.<br><br>
            Thinking you are undeserving or unworthy is not true. Thinking changing environment only while still behaving the same
            will change your circumstances is not true. Thinking change is impossible is not true. Thinking life is not worth living
            is not true. Learn to recognize falseness in your thinking.<br><br>
            Let the world know you love yourself enough to do what is best for you. Feel sorry for the people who are ignorant and
            judge you. And know suffering and pain have an expiration date.<br><br>
            And most importantly… Include God.<br><br>
            With that, I conclude this book. I hope it was helpful somehow. Maybe you learnt how to be or how not to be. Whatever
            you took away, I hope this book edified you. If I mentioned you in my story, know that I mixed some stories.<br><br> 
            As of now, June 2024, I will keep pursing my BS in Software Development from BYU-Idaho through BYU Pathway Worldwide. I
            still got a lot of unanswered questions. But… just 15 mins at a time.<br><br>
