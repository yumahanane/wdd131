            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>I first named this Meu Livro (Portuguese for My Book). I have always been very lazy to write, but for the first time I
            was able to write something. It started as one page only. And I did not think it was going to go more than that. But I
            still liked the fact that I thought I could write a whole book. Then, I thought of the name Chronicles of Yuman (as in,
            stories of Yuma who is just a human).<br><br>
            The truth is that the name does not really matter for me. I still have not decided if I am going to keep this for my
            future children only or make it public. I have talked about a lot of serious and hurtful things here in a way that does
            not reflect how sad I truly feel. But I am new to expressing my thoughts and feelings. Not just in writing, just in
            general. Then, I can only hope for your empathy.<br><br>
            I give thanks to the author of Bird by Bird who has inspired me to write, and to my very good friend B who is my only
            fan.</p>
